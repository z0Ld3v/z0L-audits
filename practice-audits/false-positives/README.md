# False Positives

This folder contains security findings that were initially reported during audit contests or personal assessments but were later judged to be invalid, low severity, or not exploitable under intended assumptions.

## Purpose

These writeups are preserved to:

- Demonstrate my thought process and methodology when analyzing contracts.
- Show growth and lessons learned from real audit feedback.
- Highlight edge cases or logic paths that *could* be dangerous in different contexts.
- Serve as future references for similar patterns or assumptions in other audits.

## Structure

Each subfolder is organized by platform (e.g., Code4rena, Sherlock) and then by contest or project.

## Why include invalid findings?

Security research is complex, and not every valid-looking issue results in a bounty or confirmation. Including false positives:

- Reflects the full scope of analysis and effort.
- Demonstrates curiosity, critical thinking, and willingness to learn.
- Documents edge cases and contract quirks that others may miss.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These findings should not be taken as real vulnerabilities unless confirmed. They are preserved for educational and growth purposes only.

## Future Additions

- Annotated reviews of judge feedback (where available).
- Links to source repos or contest pages.
- Comparisons between similar issues across audits.
